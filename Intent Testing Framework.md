# Intent Testing Framework for GenAI Development

Below is a **refined “Intent Testing” framework** designed for **LLM-assisted (Generative AI) development workflows**. It aims to systematically ensure that the code you get from an LLM aligns with your true requirements—minimizing misinterpretations, hallucinations, and subtle deviations from your actual intent. The focus is on **explicitly verifying** understanding at every critical step, from prompt creation to final application behavior.

---

## **Goal**
**Ensure the LLM (and the resulting code) truly matches your intended requirements, rather than merely producing plausible or technically correct outputs.**

---

## **Core Principles**
1. **Explicitness**  
   - Spell out requirements (and your interpretation) in a highly structured manner (e.g., acceptance criteria, Gherkin syntax).  
   - Provide clarity on edge cases and potential ambiguities before coding starts.

2. **Verification**  
   - Prompt the LLM to restate or explain plans/code in its own words.  
   - Use direct questioning to confirm that it “understands” the feature’s purpose.

3. **Early Feedback**  
   - Catch mismatches as soon as possible (e.g., during requirement prompting or code outline stages).  
   - Correct them immediately to avoid time-consuming rewrites later.

4. **Iterative Refinement**  
   - Continuously refine prompts, acceptance criteria, and tests based on each round of LLM outputs.  
   - Use feedback from real usage, QA tests, and stakeholder input to improve future prompts.

5. **Human Oversight**  
   - Even the best LLMs can hallucinate or misinterpret.  
   - Developers, QA engineers, and stakeholders must regularly confirm that each step’s output aligns with the actual business or user intent.

## **Framework Components & Stages**

### **Stage 1: Requirement Definition & Prompt Engineering**

**Objective**  
- Make your intent as explicit as possible before any code generation happens.

**Techniques**  
1. **Intent Clarification Prompts**  
   - Before writing a “generate code” prompt, ask the LLM to critique your requirements, highlight ambiguous areas, and suggest clarifications.  
   - **Example Prompt**:  
     > "Review these requirements for [Feature X]. Identify potential ambiguities, edge cases, or areas where my intent might be unclear."

2. **Structured Prompting**  
   - Provide acceptance criteria and even Gherkin-style scenarios in your prompt if using BDD.  
   - If your LLM can handle it, instruct it to ask clarifying questions when it encounters ambiguity.  
   - **Example Prompt**:  
     > "Given this scenario: [scenario in Gherkin], how would you approach implementing it? If anything is unclear, please ask follow-up questions before writing code."

**Goal**  
- Eliminate as many misunderstandings as possible during the **requirements phase**.

---

### **Stage 2: Pre-Generation Verification**

**Objective**  
- Confirm the LLM’s plan aligns with your mental model, preventing large “wrong direction” coding efforts.

**Techniques**  
1. **LLM Plan Review**  
   - Ask the LLM to outline its plan or design approach before producing the full implementation.  
   - **Example Prompt**:  
     > "Before writing the code for [Feature X], outline the main classes or functions, their purposes, and how they interact."

2. **LLM Questioning**  
   - Explicitly invite the LLM to raise questions about your prompts or domain details.  
   - **Example Prompt**:  
     > "If any part of this request is ambiguous, ask for clarification before proceeding."

**Goal**  
- Catch conceptual gaps or misinterpretations **before** the LLM invests effort in generating an entire solution.

---

### **Stage 3: Post-Generation Analysis & Review**

**Objective**  
- Validate that the generated code truly reflects your requirements, not just a “technically feasible” or partial solution.

**Techniques**  
1. **Code Annotation & Explanation**  
   - Ask the LLM to comment on or explain each part of the generated code, detailing how it meets your stated requirements.  
   - **Example Prompt**:  
     > "Explain how each function in your solution addresses [Requirement X], and why you chose this approach."

2. **Assumption Surfacing**  
   - Ask the LLM to list assumptions it made about input types, data flow, or usage.  
   - **Example Prompt**:  
     > "What assumptions did you make about user input validation or database schema when generating this code?"

3. **Critical Code Review (Human)**  
   - A developer or QA engineer reviews the code specifically to check **intent alignment** (not just correctness).  
   - Ask: “Does this code do what we intended, or just what the LLM *thinks* we intended?”

**Goal**  
- **Confirm** (via LLM self-explanation and human review) that the code is functionally aligned with the real goal and not drifting or missing corner cases.

---

### **Stage 4: Behavioral Validation (Connecting to Traditional Testing)**

**Objective**  
- Integrate intent testing with traditional QA methods (unit, integration, and acceptance tests).

**Techniques**  
1. **Intent-Focused Test Case Generation**  
   - Prompt the LLM to generate tests specifically aiming to validate **core intent**.  
   - **Example Prompt**:  
     > "Generate test cases that confirm [Feature X] meets the core user outcome: [explicit statement of desired behavior]. Include edge cases for [condition Y]."

2. **BDD Scenario Alignment** (if used)  
   - If using a BDD framework (e.g., Cucumber), verify that the code is indeed handling all “Given/When/Then” steps.  
   - The LLM can generate step definitions or even propose additional scenarios.

3. **Exploratory Testing (Human)**  
   - QA or dev manually tests the app looking specifically for “intent mismatches” (i.e., the feature works, but not in the intended way).  
   - Example: If the requirement was “disable the user’s account after 5 failed login attempts,” does the code actually do that?

**Goal**  
- Ensure the **final running software** matches the functional (and often user-experience) intent behind each feature.

---

## **Roles & Responsibilities**

- **Developer**  
  - Crafts clear prompts and acceptance criteria.  
  - Reviews LLM plans and code explanations for alignment with the real-world problem.  
  - Guides test generation (TDD, BDD, or otherwise).

- **QA Engineer**  
  - Focuses on intent-focused test scenarios and exploratory testing.  
  - Helps refine acceptance criteria or identify ambiguous prompts.  
  - Possibly uses “meta-tests” to ensure the LLM’s prompts themselves are robust.

- **Product Owner / Stakeholder**  
  - May review high-level LLM plans or BDD scenarios to confirm the business logic is correctly captured.  
  - Provides domain context for edge cases the LLM might not automatically consider.

---

## **Tooling**

1. **The LLM**  
   - For clarifying requirements, generating code, and proposing or explaining tests.  
   - Optionally a separate LLM session or instance for “second opinion” code reviews (to mitigate self-confirmation).

2. **Prompt Management**  
   - Store and version your prompts, so you can improve them over time.  
   - Helps you track which prompt changes led to better/worse alignment.

3. **BDD Frameworks (Optional)**  
   - Tools like **Cucumber**, **SpecFlow**, or **Behave** tie plain-language scenarios to automated tests.

4. **Static Analysis & Traditional QA Tools**  
   - Linting, security scanners, and code coverage tools.  
   - While not “intent testers,” they help confirm baseline technical correctness and highlight suspicious logic.

---

## **Evolution of the Framework**

- As LLMs become more advanced (e.g., better at asking clarifying questions), the intensity of “pre-generation checks” might decrease—*but humans will still need to confirm alignment.*  
- More advanced “meta-prompting” or “chain-of-thought” methods may emerge, further validating LLM interpretation of requirements.

---

## **Summary**

The **Intent Testing Framework** addresses the **unique challenges of LLM-driven development**, where the biggest risk isn’t always raw bugs, but rather **misinterpretations** and **misalignments**. By **continuously verifying** understanding (via plan reviews, code explanations, explicit tests, and human oversight), you reduce the likelihood of shipping features that “work” but **don’t** solve the actual problem you intended to fix.

> **Key Takeaway**: **Intent Testing** complements traditional QA—**it’s a proactive approach** ensuring that **everyone (human + AI)** is on the same page about what the feature is really supposed to do.
